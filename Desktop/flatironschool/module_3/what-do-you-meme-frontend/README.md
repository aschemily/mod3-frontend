## What Do You Meme

What Do You Meme is a single page web application designed for meme lovers to create their own. This Vanilla JavsaScript app allows users to select images from online, upload them and create a caption that can either be displayed on the top or bottom of the photo. 


### Technologies 

What Do You Meme was created with a Ruby on Rails backend with a PostgressSQL database and a Vanilla JS frontend. Additional frameworks and libraries used include: 

- Semantic UI 

Github to backend can be found [here] (https://github.com/aschemily/what_do_you_meme_backend)

### Key Features
The full demo can be found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRoxwPnspIM)

Users have full CRUD functionality with the ability edit/delete without a page refresh. Users also have the ability to like their own memes.

## Future Development

The major focus of the application was to create a full CRUD meme generator with an added social component. With more time additional features would include: 
- Sign Up/ Login
- Followers for users to look at others memes that have been created
- Implement a popular/trending page of all the memes based on the like count 
- Ability to upload/ share on social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter)
